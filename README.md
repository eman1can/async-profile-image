# Async Profile Image

This repository contains code for displaying a profile image. If you want to display a rectangular image, then use ProfileImage. If you want to use a circular image, then use a CircularProfileImage. In both cases, you will want to set the source of the profile image and then call update_crop_values with the width, height, center_x, and center_y values that you want applied to the image. These can be calculated manually, say from a database, or given from the ProfileImageCropper widget.
